def dist(pos1, pos2, L=None):
    '''
    Calculate L2 norm distance between a set of points
    and either a reference point or another set of points.
    Optionally includes periodicity.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    pos1: ndarray of shape (N,m)
        A set of points
    pos2: ndarray of shape (N,m) or (m,) or (1,m)
        A single point or set of points
    L: float, optional
        The box size. Will do a periodic wrap if given.
    
    Returns
