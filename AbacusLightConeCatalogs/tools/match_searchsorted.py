def match_halo_pids_to_lc_rvint(nsubsamp, hpid, rvint, lcpid):
    '''
    Given that we have a list of halos in the light cone, match their
    subsample PIDs to light cone particle PIDs in a sorted "zipper".
    Record the RVint of matched particles, and the halo ID, as we go.
    Then, at the end, gather the RVints in halo order by sorting on
    those halo IDs.  Return the RVints, along with the counts per halo.
    
    TODO: this may rearrange the list of subsample PIDs within a halo. Do we
    need to preserve the order, because we save the densest as the first,
    for example?
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    nsubsamp: ndarray of int, shape (H,)
        Number of subsample PIDs per halo, providing the association of
        halo to PID. `sum(nsubsamp)` should equal `N`, the length of `hpid`.
    hpid: ndarray of int, shape (N,)
        An array of halo subsample particle PIDs, indexed by nsubsamp.
    rvint: ndarray of int, shape (M,3)
        An array of pos & vel of the light cone particles, stored as RVint,
        and row-matched to `lcpid`.
    lcpid: ndarray of int, shape (M,)
        Light cone particle PIDs, row-matched to `rvint`.
    
    Returns
    -------
    nmatch: ndarray of int, shape (H,)
        An array like `nsubsamp` that provides the assocation of halo
        to rvint. `sum(nmatch_per_halo)` should equal `L`.
        In a perfect world, if every particle has a match, then this
        array is completely identical to `nsubsamp`.
    hrvint: ndarray of int, shape (L,)
        Array of RVints for the halo particles, in the same order as
        `haloid` (so grouped by halo)
